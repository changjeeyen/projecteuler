# Projecteuler #6 sum square difference
# run number from 1 to 100
# square each number then add the sum of squares
# add each number to sum, square at i = 100
# difference between the square of sums and sum of squares

sumsq = 0 # sum of the square
sum = 0 # just add each number first before square
diff = 0 # difference of sq of sum and sumsq

for i in range (101): #need 101 to stop at 100
  sumsq = sumsq + i*i
  sum = sum + i

diff = (sum*sum) - sumsq
